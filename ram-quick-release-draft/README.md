# RAM-style Quick Release Joint (Draft)

This is a **draft concept model** for a quick-release cam-lock arm intended to replace knob tightening on a ball joint.

File:
- `ram-quick-release-draft.scad`

## What this draft demonstrates
- Split clamp around a 1" (B-size) style ball
- Cam lever concept for over-center clamping
- Space for metal axle/pins

## What is NOT done yet
- Over-center geometry tuning
- Fatigue/safety analysis
- Positive safety latch
- Vibration validation for motorcycle use

## Prototype guidance
- Print in PETG for fit check only
- Use stainless pins/bolts for load path
- Final use should be nylon/PA-CF + metal hardware

## Next iteration plan
1. Add explicit over-center kinematics
2. Add secondary safety latch
3. Add preload adjust screw
4. Add TPU friction liner seats
5. Bench pull + vibration test before road use
